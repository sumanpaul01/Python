# 1.The following is a list of 10 students ages:
# ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
# I. Sort the list and find the min and max age
# II. Add the min age and the max age again to the list
# III. Find the median age (one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
# IV. Find the average age (sum of all items divided by their number )
# V. Find the range of the ages (max minus min)
# VI. Compare the value of (min - average) and (max - average), use _abs()_ method
